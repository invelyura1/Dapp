This app is an Android login interface that allows users to sign in using two distinct methods: traditional and decentralized. The local login feature prompts users to enter their username and password, which is then checked against a preset pair ("debo" for both fields). If the credentials match, the app grants access and navigates to the main section, displaying a success notification. Otherwise, it shows an error message indicating failure.Additionally, the app integrates blockchain-based login through the Hive Keychain browser extension. Users can input their Hive account name and initiate authentication via the WebView component. This browser-based method ensures a secure, decentralized login, offering a modern alternative to standard username-password systems. The layout features input fields for credentials, buttons for both login methods, and a hidden WebView that activates during the Hive Keychain process.
